As part of my internship at **Code Alpha**, I developed **"Translate It" v1**, a mobile application that provides multilingual text translation and speech output.

## ✨ Features

* 🌍 **Translate between multiple languages**:

  | `ar`      | Arabic               |
  | `fr`      | French               |
  | `de`      | German               |
  | `es`      | Spanish              |

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. ✅ Created **Azure Translator** and **Resource Group** in *North Italy* region.

## 🛠 Tools & Tech Stack

* **Android** (Kotlin)
* **Azure Cognitive Services** (Translator API)

## ⚠️ Notes

* This is a **basic demo version** using a free Azure resource.
* API keys were **not secured** in the first version (now deleted).
* For production, I should make more approaches for this like backend 
* Azure’s scalable plans make it easy to upgrade for deployment.
